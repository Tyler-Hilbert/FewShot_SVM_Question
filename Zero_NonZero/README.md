This is a test for how an increasing class imbalance impacts the F1, precision and recall of MNIST.  
There are various different tests when comparing a 0 vs 1 classifier.  
Below is a test where the training set included all digits (with the labels 0 or non-zero), but the validation set only included 0 and 1.
